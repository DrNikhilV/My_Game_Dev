Open the Sliding_Puzzle.py code in any directory.
Place an image named "puzzle_image.png" in the same directory (or the code will use colored tiles instead).
Run the program.

The game features:

A 3x3 grid where tiles can be moved by clicking or using arrow keys
Move counter
New Game button to restart
Win detection
Support for both image tiles and colored tiles
Keyboard controls using arrow keys

To move tiles:

Click on any tile adjacent to the empty space to move it
Use arrow keys to move tiles into the empty space
Try to arrange the tiles in the correct order (1-8 with the empty space in the bottom-right)

Note: Here I've used the poster of Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness as my sample image. You can use any image you want by simply naming it puzzle_image.png and placing it in the same directory as the code.
